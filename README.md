# The Open Missing Persons Database project

### General Notes and Questions

Welcome to the open missings persons Archive, this platform will aid to support with the investigations of un-identified body cases and missing persons, there will also be a portal for legal and law enforcement bodies to track cases within a certain period, this platform will allow users to report cases about missing persons, known sightings and provide resources to help such persons within this period to create enough awareness about the cases within this period.

This platform will maintain an archive of all information which is published within its domain,
users can query the database to search for current cases, un-resolved and resolved cases, and see if there is a law enforcement handler on any of the cases.

**_From our previous meetings we have been able to ascertain some major issues_**.

### First meeting Narrative
  So in summary, we agreed on keeping "missing persons" as the name of our project, we'd be building a searchable database for missing people in Nigeria and raise a bit of awareness for each case via social media posts and then give updates as the cases progress. We would also try to reach out to law enforcement agencies and give them access to the database. During development we would be taking a mobile first approach and build towards local multi-language support `by @chibuzor_in`


### Second Meeting Narrative
We ascertained that we would work together with law enforcement to improve tracking and adaptation of the platorm. and that law enforcement will only have branding and or visibility rights to any case. working with any district can allow us trigger alerts to any of their supplied contact information
