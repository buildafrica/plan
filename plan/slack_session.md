##  Slack Session Summary by @tayo__
The HOW DO WE Section held by 8PM , 19/10/17
The first question which was deliberated on was based on how to verify the validity of user supplied information 
Initial opinions suggested manually verifying by checking online for any information about the missing person but We came to a more efficient way by allowing users to post but having a report button on each post . When the post is reported , we investigate the case.
Also , users can “vouch” a missing persons case , more vouches increase the reliability of a case .

The Second Question: If we allow users to sign up for alerts via emails with the aim of spreading the info about new missing cases ,Who can sign up for Amber Alerts?

Law enforcement officials should be the major links to these alerts for safety reasons and also , a question came up about verifying who is a Law Enforcement Agent , we agreed that each Law Enforcement branch / sub division should have a special log in information which enables them to the Law Enforcement privileges on the web service 

Lastly , How do we ensure adoption of the program ?

We agreed that adoption should sort itself out , we should stick to bringing to project to life for now .

  So in summary, we agreed on keeping "missing persons" as the name of our project, we'd be building a searchable database for missing people in Nigeria and raise a bit of awareness for each case via social media posts and then give updates as the cases progress. We would also try to reach out to law enforcement agencies and give them access to the database. During development we would be taking a mobile first approach and build towards local multi-language support
